# Motivation-Not-Found
A quirky 404 error page for developers who need chocolate 🍫
## 🧠 404 - Motivation Not Found

A quirky developer-themed 404 error page made entirely with **HTML + CSS**.  
Because sometimes you open VS Code… and end up on YouTube. 😩

## 🔍 What is this?

This isn’t your typical error page.

It’s a **relatable, fun, and dark-mode-friendly UI** that:

Shows fake console logs like:
  > Brain RAM usage: 99%`
  > Energy: 14% ⚡`
  >Gives a “Suggested Fix”: Eat a chocolate 🍫
Includes a **retry** button (which just reloads the page, not your motivation 😅)


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom styling, dev-style theme)

No frameworks, no libraries — just good old frontend fun.
